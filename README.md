# Optimization-based Radar Reconstruction Algorithm

This repository contains the code used in the implementation of the 
optimization-based radar reconstruction (ORR) algorithm in
breast microwave sensing, as presented in [1].

The data used in this analysis is presented in [1] and is available 
[here](https://bit.ly/UM-bmid). To use these data files with this
repository, place the data files `fd_data_gen_three_s11.pickle`
and `metadata_gen_three.pickle` in the `/UM-BMID/gen-three/simple-clean/`
from [here](https://bit.ly/UM-bmid) folder in the `../data/` folder
of this repository.
